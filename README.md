# Simple snake time
Implemented a simple snake game including logic for the growth of the snake, the player score and death conditions. The snake can go through the edges of the field and appear on the other side ecause that's how I played it when I was a kid and I like it!
## Instalation
Run the following to install:
'''
git clone https://github.com/dvdimitrov13/Snake-project snake
cd snake
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To start the game run:
```
python snake.py
```
